            <p id="work-positions">Assistant System Engineer - Trainee</p>
            <p>Right after I graduated with my Bachelor's degree, I joined <a href="https://www.tcs.com" id="tcs-name">
              Tata Consultancy Services</a> as an Assistant System Engineer-Trainee and worked with them for over
              6 months from December 2014 until July 2015. I underwent a 12-week training program for fresh graduates
              at their Hyberabad, India location where I was trained in Core and Advanced Java, and other frameworks
              widely used by Tata for providing software solutions to their clients.
              After completing the training, I worked out of their client, the State Bank of India's
              Global IT Center located at Belapur, Navi Mumbai, where I was a Production Support Executive
              for the <span class="gcrms">Green Card Remittance Management System</span>, an initiative by the State Bank
              of India to facilitate paperless remittance in over 14,000 branches all over India. I quit
              TCS in order to pursue my Master's degree.</p>

            <p id="work-positions">Student Worker- Customer Service Specialist</p>
            <p>As a full-time student at <a href="https://www.asu.edu" class="asu">Arizona State University</a>,
              I worked on-campus at the ASU Help Center. I was a Student Worker and a Customer Service Specialist
              with them from June 2016 to May 2017. I assisted current as well as prospective students, parents,
              faculty and staff by answering their questions about literally anything and everything at ASU, from
              general queries, admission prospects, transcripts, events, to even some IT related issues related to the
              ASU wifi, online examinations and account management. This greatly helped me improve my customer service
              and interpersonal skills, while honing my written and oral communication skills. I would advice
              students to work on-campus at the ASU Help Center because it really helps you grow as a person!</p>
