            I am from Mumbai, India and I currently live in the Phoenix, Arizona area in the United States.
            I work as a Software Engineer with a company in Tempe, creating web applications, services and
            mobile apps. I moved to Tempe in August 2015 to pursue my Master's degree at
            <a href="https://www.asu.edu" class="asu">Arizona State University</a>.
            After 2 years, 4 semesters, 10 classes, 3 dozen assignments and numerous sleepless nights, I graduated
            with a <span class="degree">Master of Computer Science</span> degree in May 2017. I did my Bachelor's in
            Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai and graduated in May 2014.<br><br>
            I believe in maintaining my work and life balance pretty well, which is why I cool myself down
            by exercising and working out. I believe in the saying, "A Healthy Body has a Healthy Mind".
            Lifting weights destresses me and makes me energetic!
            I love watching Soccer and Cricket as well, and you can find me playing FIFA on my <span class="xbox">XBox</span>
            a lot!
            I am a huge Cristiano Ronaldo fan, he was the reason I started following soccer, and naturally
            I like Real Madrid FC!<br><br>
            I am usually hesitant to start watching a new TV show, because I get engrossed in it so much, that
            I end up binge watching it. My favorite TV show is F.R.I.E.N.D.S. and I quote a lot from it in my
            everyday life. I mean, could this show BE any better? I also enjoy watching <span class="got">
            Game of Thrones</span> a lot and I obsess over it! Some of my other favorite shows include, The Big Bang Theory,
            Suits, Riverdale and I also love watching Stand-up comedy gigs on Netflix! I also watch Bollywood
            movies, because they provide good entertainment and because I am from India and I enjoy that stuff!<br><br>
            I am here to create a stereotype of a geek who works out, enjoys sports and loves watching TV!
